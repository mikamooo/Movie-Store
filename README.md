# Movie-Store

This is a shopping system for purchasing movies that will function as an online store in which users must create/log into their account in order to purchase a movie from the storeâ€™s catalog. The system is backed by PostgresSql and fronted by C++ programs that connect to the database to perform queries. The user interface is text-based, and users will interact by responding to given prompts in the terminal.
